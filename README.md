This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Install packages: ```npm install``` and then make sure to have cross-env installed globally on your machine: ```npm install cross-env -g```.

Open the env.example file and fill in the missing fields, and then save it as a .env file.

You can now run the development server: ```npm run dev```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Working Demo
A working demo can be found at https://nft-bridge.muon.net. Connect your wallet and happy bridging!
